I'm in the process to finish my professional carreer in one of the Public Universities of Nicaragua (At UNI), As a future Computer Engineering. As a child, on my free weekends I was always working for my neighbor in his Cyber Cafe, I have always felt interest in the tech world, its functionality and of what was it made of, Speaking of both side: hardware and software. So far with my experience at UNI, I have realize how simple and how complex could be a program, a game, a web page, give maintenance to a PC or even if you want to put your own network in your home!

As a future full stack developer and Engineering, I'd like to be able to build softwares as simple as they can be, beginning with the core (Code Side) and what the user can see and use from them, I'd like to create and contribute to any company to give professional, short and quality solutions to any problem that could face it.

## Skills

- Achievements

As a result of my bad times at UNI searching information about starting to code web pages and desktop App from zero, I decided to create a group with my classmates where we could help us each other, the goal was if any of us felt struggled in any circumstance we could give opinion and solution to the problem faced. Although we didn't learn fully complete how to code from zero but we learned good and new things.

#### Fast learner

I had an opportunity to work and help to complete a tech project in 6 month in Nicaragua inside of a public Clinic from Ciudad Sandino, that included the combination of a web page and Wifi network configuration with Mikrotik Technology, My role was to create and deploy a reliable Wifi that supported the connection from all the patients that visit the Clinic and redirect them to the web App before they have access to internet with the intention of educate them and also give a secure and private Wifi to the personal from it. My main opportunity aside of give my contribution, was to learn a new technology by my own.

#### Open mind

I have the thought that you should be open to learn and do new things because that is a good way to grow every day, as an example I worked for my father, as a private driver and translator for foreginers, driving them In and Outside of Managua, Nicaragua. It's was an exceptional experince.
